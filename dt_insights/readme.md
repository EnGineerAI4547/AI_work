# Machine Learning Classifiers Insight Project

## Introduction
This project endeavors to delve into and provide insights on the behavior of classical machine learning classifiers including Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). A focal point is the propensity of Decision Trees to overfit, especially when handling complex or noisy data. The exploration extends to regression problems using Decision Trees, illustrating the impact of tree depth on overfitting.

## Objective
- To understand and visualize how different classifiers demarcate decision boundaries on the same dataset.
- To identify the circumstances under which overfitting occurs in Decision Trees.
- To observe the effects of varying the maximum depth parameter in Decision Tree regression.
- To compare the generalization performance of these classifiers on unseen data.

## Datasets
- Iris dataset for classification problems.
- Synthetic dataset generated using a noisy quadratic function for regression problems.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Execution
The script `classifier_insight.py` encapsulates the essence of this exploration. It:
1. Loads the Iris dataset.
2. Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Standardizes the feature values.
4. Trains Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and SVM classifiers on the training data.
5. Visualizes the decision boundaries created by each classifier.
6. Displays confusion matrices to exhibit how well each model generalizes to unseen data.

The script `regression_insight.py` delves into regression problems with Decision Trees. It:
1. Generates a synthetic dataset using a noisy quadratic function.
2. Trains two Decision Tree regressors with different maximum depths.
3. Visualizes the regression predictions to elucidate the impact of tree depth on overfitting.

## Visualization
The visualizations portray the decision boundaries of each classifier on a 2D plane and the regression predictions of Decision Tree regressors. Through these visualizations, the project elucidates how the Decision Tree creates more intricate decision boundaries and is prone to overfitting, especially as the maximum depth increases.

## Insights
- The overfitting propensity of Decision Trees is discernible when compared to Logistic Regression and SVM, especially in complex or noisy datasets.
- In regression problems, increasing the maximum depth of the Decision Tree leads to overfitting as the model starts to learn the noise in the data.

## Future Work
- Investigate other classifiers such as Random Forests, Naive Bayes, etc.
- Explore ensemble methods to mitigate overfitting in Decision Trees.
- Extend the analysis to multi-dimensional datasets and observe the behavior of these classifiers.
